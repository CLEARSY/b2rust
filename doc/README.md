# English version

The english version of the usermanual is well written.

# French version

The french version of the usermanual has some mispelling and minor confusing things.

# Warning

The sees clause is not well translated yet; instead of having a reference to an imported structure; the translation has a reference to a new instance which is independent to the imported one.
