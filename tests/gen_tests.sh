# This file is read during the `cmake` compilation.
# Each directory among ($3, $4, $5) aggregates a category of tests. It is the purpose of this script to generate in the file $2 a line to indicate CMake which script to call and with which parameters for every test which exists.
# In each directory, thereâ€™s a `test.sh` script which takes unspecified parameters and which performs a certain test (the work this script do depends on the category of the test).
# $3 is the `comparison` directory; it executes b2rust on the given BXML files and checks if the output matches a given Rust code file.
# $4 is the `errors` directory; it executes b2rust on the given BXML files and checks that b2rust refuses to generate code for these files.
# $5 is the `main` directory; it executes b2rust on the given BXML files, compile the result, compile a given `main.rs` file, and executes the generated binary.


# $1: the executable of the program.
# $2 is the file where the line is generated.
# $3 is the `comparison` directory.
# $4: the `errors` directory.
# $5: the `main` directory.
